"""Module for partial classes.

To declare a class partial, inherit from partial.partial and from
the full class, like so

from partial import *
import original_module

class ExtendedClass(partial, original_module.FullClass):
    def additional_method(self, args):
        body
    more_methods

After this class definition is executed, original_method.FullClass
will have all the additional properties defined in ExtendedClass;
the name ExtendedClass is of no importance (and becomes an alias
for FullClass),
It is an error if the original class already contains the
definitions being added, unless they are methods declared
with @replace.
